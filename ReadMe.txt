The study achieved promising results, with an accuracy of 76.3% on a dataset of fake news articles. Another study by Jin et al. (2019) proposed a hybrid deep learning model that combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to detect fake news. The study used a dataset of news articles from several sources, including Snopes, Politifact, and FactCheck.org, and achieved an accuracy of 92.5%.In a study by Li et al. (2021), the authors proposed a fake news detection system that combines NLP techniques with graph convolutional networks (GCN) to capture the structural information of news articles.
